    <h2>2. Coding Standards</h2>

    <h3>Style Guides</h3>

    <h4>JavaScript &amp; React / Next.js</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Baseline Standards:</strong> Use the Airbnb JavaScript style guide as a baseline, supplemented by ESLint rules to enforce consistency. For React and Next.js projects, follow component best practices (such as functional components with hooks) and consider adopting Prettier for automatic code formatting.
    </p>

    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Adherence to PEP8:</strong> Adhere to PEP8 guidelines to ensure readability and maintainability. Tools like Flake8 or pylint, integrated with VS Code, can help enforce these standards.
    </p>

    <h4>Java</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Java Coding Conventions:</strong> Follow the Google Java Style Guide or Oracle’s Java conventions, ensuring that our code is consistent, clear, and maintainable across all Java-based projects.
    </p>

    <h4>General JavaScript Practices</h4>
    <p>
      Maintain consistency with ESLint and Prettier configurations to avoid style discrepancies, whether using vanilla JavaScript or frameworks.
    </p>

    <h4>VS Code Environment</h4>
    <p>
      Since VS Code is our primary editor, we recommend using relevant extensions (such as ESLint, Prettier, Python, and Java support plugins) and sharing workspace settings to ensure that everyone benefits from a consistent development setup.
    </p>

    <h3>Inline Code Documentation</h3>
    <p>
      Clear inline documentation is crucial for maintaining a codebase that is both understandable and maintainable. It helps team members quickly grasp the intent behind code segments and facilitates smoother onboarding. Below are the guidelines for documenting code in our primary languages:
    </p>

    <h4>JavaScript/React/Next.js</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Use JSDoc-style comments to explain functions, components, and any complex logic.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Include a brief description of the function’s purpose.</li>
        <li>Explain parameters and their expected types.</li>
        <li>Describe the expected return value and its type.</li>
        <li>Note any exceptions or edge cases handled.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4>Python</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Employ comprehensive docstrings (using reStructuredText or NumPy style) within modules, classes, and functions.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a summary of what the function or class does.</li>
        <li>List input parameters, their types, and any default values.</li>
        <li>Describe the return value and any exceptions that might be raised.</li>
        <li>Include additional context to aid understanding.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4>Java</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilize Javadoc comments to document classes, methods, and interfaces.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin with a concise summary of the class or method’s purpose.</li>
        <li>Use <code>@param</code> to describe parameters, <code>@return</code> for return types, and <code>@throws</code> for exceptions.</li>
        <li>This helps generate professional and comprehensive API documentation.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. External Documentation</h2>

    <h3>What is a README File?</h3>
    <p>
      A README file is a foundational document that introduces a project. It provides essential information about the project’s purpose, structure, and usage. Typically written in Markdown for readability and accessibility, the README serves as the first point of contact for developers, stakeholders, and new team members. It is intended to answer key questions such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What does this project do?</li>
      <li>How do I set it up?</li>
      <li>How is it organized?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Global README File</h3>
    <p>
      Every repository should have a top-level (global) README file that offers a comprehensive overview of the project. This file should include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Project Overview:</strong>

    <h2>5. Deployment Processes</h2>

    <h3>Environments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Development:</strong> Used for local testing and feature development. This environment should mirror key aspects of production for effective debugging and rapid iteration.</li>
      <li><strong>Staging:</strong> A pre-production environment where integrated features are thoroughly tested. It should replicate production settings (configurations, databases, third-party integrations) to ensure accurate testing.</li>
      <li><strong>Production:</strong> The live environment accessed by end users. Deployments here must be rigorously tested and approved from staging to ensure stability, performance, and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deployment Automation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automation Tools:</strong> Utilize CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) to automate build, test, and deployment processes, reducing human error and accelerating release cycles.</li>
      <li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Use Docker to package applications and dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production.</li>
      <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Manage containerized applications with Kubernetes (or similar tools) for scalability, high availability, and automated tasks (rolling updates, self-healing, load balancing).</li>
      <li><strong>Scripting:</strong> Maintain scripts for routine deployment tasks (database migrations, environment variable setups, service restarts). Ensure scripts are version-controlled and documented.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rollback Procedures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pre-Deployment Backups:</strong> Create backups or snapshots of critical systems, databases, and configurations before deploying changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Version Tagging:</strong> Tag stable releases in the repository to easily revert to a known good state if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Automated Rollback Mechanisms:</strong> Integrate rollback procedures into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically revert changes if critical tests fail.</li>
      <li><strong>Manual Rollback Guidelines:</strong> Document clear, step-by-step instructions for reverting code changes and re-deploying the last known good version, including post-deployment testing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Monitoring &amp; Logging</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Monitoring Tools:</strong> Implement tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic to continuously monitor performance, resource usage, and system health, with alerts for anomalies.</li>
      <li><strong>Logging Practices:</strong> Use centralized logging solutions (e.g., ELK Stack or Splunk) to collect and analyze logs, ensuring critical events and errors are captured for troubleshooting.</li>
      <li><strong>Post-Deployment Validation:</strong> Run automated health checks and performance tests after deployments. Regularly review monitoring dashboards to catch issues early.</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation &amp; Reporting:</strong> Maintain records of each deployment (what was deployed, when, issues encountered, resolution steps, and monitoring metrics) to inform continuous process improvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Security &amp; Compliance</h2>

    <h3>Code Security</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Secure Coding Practices:</strong> Follow secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP Top Ten) to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Regularly audit code and use automated security scanners.</li>
      <li><strong>Dependency Management:</strong> Keep libraries and dependencies updated, using tools like Snyk, Dependabot, or npm audit to monitor for vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure Design Patterns:</strong> Apply principles such as least privilege, defense in depth, and fail-safe defaults. Enforce strict access controls to protect sensitive data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secrets Management</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sensitive Data Handling:</strong> Store API keys, credentials, and secrets outside the codebase using environment variables or secure vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Ensure encryption in transit and at rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Limit access to secrets only to required processes or users, and review permissions regularly.</li>
      <li><strong>Automation &amp; Auditing:</strong> Integrate secrets management into CI/CD pipelines so that sensitive data is injected at runtime rather than stored in source control. Maintain logs and audit trails for access to secrets.</li>
    </ul>
